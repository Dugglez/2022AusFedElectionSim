# 2022AusFedElectionSim
A Python Project used to view the results of the previous election and predict the future* 



Further information available in readme. If you have any ideas, leave a comment? (haven't used github before, maybe you leave a bug report or something?)  



*as the last election showed, no one can predict the future.
